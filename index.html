          <p>Quinnat was the inspiration and start of our amazing journey to this point. Quinnat found us while we were camping at Point Hope, Alaska. We got caught in a storm and Quinnat became the only food we had for two days! In their honor we hope you enjoy the salmon products as much as we do.</p>
